# Client Task B #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

Start the Application
	Welcome the customer
		"Welcome to the Warehouse! Where do you want to go in the store today?"
				
			Customer inputs TARGET location (targetX, targetY),
			Application defines where the Customer is located right now (CURRENT location, currentX, currentY),
			Application defines the number of Steps at 0 at the CURRENT position
			Application determines the amount of Steps and the Path required to get from CURRENT to TARGET

Application displays Customer the CURRENT position and displays a Path to get to the TARGET position

	While the CURRENT position is not the TARGET position,
			Determine customer's Movements and Direction
				
					If the direction is North 
						then display the customer moving up on the Path (decrease y by 1),
					Else if the direction is South
						then display the customer moving down on the Path (increase y by 1),
					Else if the direction is East
						then display the customer moving to the right on the Path (increase x by 1),
					Else if the direction is West
						then display the customer moving to the left on the Path (decrease x by 1)

					Increase the number of steps taken with each Movement and Direction by 1
				
	Display the CURRENT position as the Customer moves and changes directions

	Check to see if the Customer has Arrived at the TARGET location
			
			If CURRENT position equals the TARGET location
				then "Congratulations! You have reached your destination! Is there anywhere else you'd like to go to in the store today Y/N?"
					(if Y then return to Start the Application, else "Thank you for using the App!")
			Else, return to determining Customer's Movements and Direction
